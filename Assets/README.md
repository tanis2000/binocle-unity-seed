Binocle for Unity Seed Project
==============================

This is the sample project of Binocle for Unity.
It serves as a boilerplate and example of how to work with Binocle.

Current status
==============
This project is still an alpha version. I still need to add most of the basics as I really haven't had the time to commit to it till now.
I have a few games using Binocle for Unity and I will port pieces of them into this project as it will make starting a new game a lot easier.
